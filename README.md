# 🚗 Automatic License Plate Detection and Recognition

This project uses **OpenCV** and **Tesseract OCR** to automatically detect and recognize license plates from images of vehicles. The project applies edge detection, contour finding, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to extract the license plate from an image and convert it to text.

## 🎯 Features
- **Edge Detection**: Uses Canny edge detection to identify prominent edges in the image.
- **Contour Detection**: Finds and filters contours based on the shape of a license plate.
- **Number Plate Extraction**: Extracts the region of the license plate from the image.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Converts the extracted number plate into machine-readable text using Tesseract.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10**
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and contour detection.
- **Tesseract OCR**: For optical character recognition.
- **imutils**: For easy image manipulation.

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KoustavDeveloper/license-plate-detection.git
    cd license-plate-detection
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed. Then, run the following:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Install Tesseract OCR**:
    - Download and install Tesseract OCR from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).
    - Make sure to add the Tesseract installation directory to your system's PATH or specify its location in the script:
      ```python
      pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
      ```

## 🔄 Usage

1. **Place the image of the car in the `Car Images/` folder**.
2. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. The script will:
    - Resize the image.
    - Convert it to grayscale.
    - Apply edge detection.
    - Find contours to isolate the license plate.
    - Crop the number plate region.
    - Use Tesseract to recognize the text from the cropped image.
    
4. **View Results**:
    - The cropped license plate will be saved in the `Cropped Images-Text/` folder.
    - The recognized text (license plate number) will be printed in the terminal.

## 📦 Folder Structure

```bash
├── Car Images/
│   └── 7.jpg                    # Place car images here
├── Cropped Images-Text/
│   └── 7.png                    # Cropped number plate image (generated by the script)
├── main.py # Main script
├── requirements.txt              # Python dependencies
└── README.md                     # Project documentation
```

## 🖼️ Example Output

After running the script, the detected number plate and its extracted text will look like this:

- **Original Image**: ![Original Image](Car Images\7.jpg)
- **Detected License Plate**: ![Detected License Plate](Cropped Images-Text\7.png)
- **Extracted Text**: `HR26BP3543`
